# git-shmart

A small collection of Git wrappers. Inspired by Geelen's _git-smart_, but
implemented in Bash.

## Motivation

I use _git-smart_ all the time, but I sometimes have to reinstall it if I switch
Ruby versions. I don't think this tool needs Ruby as a dependency.

Also, there are some issues with the original, and the original project seems to
be no longer maintained.
